*Note*: This was probably one of the first projects I ever wrote using Ruby.  For that reason, I'm loath to just delete it, but I haven't touched the main code in years.  I know better patterns now, but it's an interesting look into how a college student trying to hack together a programming assignment in a new language would approach problems.

### "Learning Decision Trees", Ruby implementation
#### CSE 4633- Artificial Intelligence
#### Submitted 11-17-2011 by Matt Hink (mrh208)

Originally written under Ruby 1.9.2p290 running on Xubuntu 11.10.

- To run the main program on the assignment dataset (car.data), run "rake exec".
- To run the main program on the dataset from the textbook, page 700, fig. 18.3, run "rake exec:test".
- To run the included test suite, run 'rake test'.

Note that this isn't a particularly efficient implementation, so it might take some time to run.  :)
