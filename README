CSE 4633- Artificial Intelligence
Assignment 3- Learning Decision Trees
Submitted 11-17-2011 by Matt Hink (mrh208)

1. REQUIREMENTS
-Developed using Ruby 1.9.2p290 on Xubuntu 11.10
-Requires 'ruby' and 'rake'
-It would probably be best to run this on a unix-based system. 

2. DOWNLOADING
  a. Using Git
    -The public readonly Git repository is available at 'git://github.com/hink1103/Learning-Decision-Trees.git'
  b. Download
    -A .zip archive of this project is available at 'https://github.com/hink1103/Learning-Decision-Trees/zipball/master'

3. RUNNING
  -Once ruby and rake are installed, run the 'rake' command to compile and run the software.
  -If for whatever reason this does not work, you can manually run the program by using 'ruby ./lib/aiproject3.rb [PATH_TO_DATASET]'. This may be required to run on Windows systems.

4. NOTES ON rake
  -To run the main program on the assignment dataset (car.data), run "rake exec".
  -To run the main program on the dataset from the textbook, page 700, fig. 18.3, run "rake exec:test".
  -To run the included test suite, run 'rake test'.

6. NOTES
  -The accuracy calculations take quite awhile- this is mainly due to Ruby being an interpreted language.  It should only take a few minutes to run the program.
